    "Heat the brandy or cognac in a heatproof glass until warm, usually about 25-30 seconds in the microwave.",
    "Sprinkle the cinnamon over the schnapps and ignite (please be careful while doing this step).",
    "Tell the person who's going to drink to use a straw to drink the shot while the flame is still on. The draught created makes the flame go higher. So be sure not to lean over the glass.",
    "When the glass is empty, cover it with your hand to cut-off the oxygen and stop the flame.",
    "Lift your hand a little bit and inhale the alcoholic gases in the glass.",
    "When finished, slam the shot glass on the bar, the down draught created by this will force the remaining gases to be expelled from the glass."
